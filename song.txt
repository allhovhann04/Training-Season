[Verse 1]
Are you
Someone that I can give my heart to?
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to?
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night
Play fair
Is that a compass in your nature?
Or are you tricky 'cause l've been there?
And, baby, I don't need to learn that lesson twice

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you really wanna go there But if you really wanna go there But if you really wanna go there
You should know I

[Chorus]
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than l've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
[Post-Chorus]
Are you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over

[Verse 2]
I tried to see my lovers in a good light
Don't wanna do it just to be nice
Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right
I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential
Is it too much to ask for?

[Chorus]
Who understands I need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
